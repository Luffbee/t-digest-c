Description: The t-digest construction algorithm uses a variant of 1-dimensional 
    k-means clustering to produce a very compact data structure that allows 
    accurate estimation of quantiles. This t-digest data structure can be used 
    to estimate quantiles, compute other rank statistics or even to estimate 
    related measures like trimmed means. The advantage of the t-digest over 
    previous digests for this purpose is that the t-digest handles data with 
    full floating point resolution. With small changes, the t-digest can handle 
    values from any ordered set for which we can compute something akin to a mean. 
    The accuracy of quantile estimates produced by t-digests can be orders of 
    magnitude more accurate than those produced by previous digest algorithms.
